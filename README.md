# Introduction to Python and Git

This repository serves as a beginner-friendly guide to fundamental concepts in Python programming and version control using Git. Whether you're new to programming or looking to refresh your knowledge, this guide will help you understand the essentials.

## Python Basics

### Data Types

- Integers: Representing quantities, e.g., `numCopies = 25`
- Floats: Representing prices, e.g., `bookPrice = 12.99`
- Strings: Storing text, e.g., `bookTitle = "The Great Gatsby"`
- Booleans: Indicating stock status, e.g., `inStock = True`

### Variables

Variables store data for easy access and manipulation.

### Operators

- Arithmetic Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` for calculations.
- Comparison Operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>` for comparisons.
- Logical Operators: `and`, `or`, `not` for combining conditions.

### Functions

Functions perform predefined tasks, e.g., `calculate_total_price(price, quantity)`.

### Control Structures

- If Statements: Making decisions based on conditions.
- Loops: Repeating tasks efficiently.
  - For Loop: Iterating over a sequence of items.
  - While Loop: Repeating as long as a condition is met.

### Lists and Dictionaries

- Lists: Storing collections of data, e.g., `book_titles = ["The Great Gatsby", "To Kill a Mockingbird"]`
- Dictionaries: Storing key-value pairs, e.g., `book_info = {"title": "The Great Gatsby", "price": 12.99, "in_stock": True}`

## Git and Version Control

### Introduction to Git

Git is a version control system for tracking changes in code over time.

### Git Workflow

1. Clone: Copy the repository to your local machine.
2. Branch: Create branches for features or changes.
3. Commit: Make and record changes with messages.
4. Push: Upload changes to the remote repository.
5. Pull Request: Propose changes for review.
6. Merge: Incorporate changes into the main branch.

### Undoing Changes

- `git reset`: Unstaging changes.
- `git checkout`: Reverting files to previous states.

### Branching and Merging

- Creating branches for parallel development.
- Fast-Forward Merge: No conflicting changes.
- Three-Way Merge: Combining divergent changes.

### Collaboration with GitHub

- Collaborators working on separate branches.
- Pull Requests for code review and integration.
- Commenting and discussion on Pull Requests.

### Handling Conflicts

- Identifying and understanding conflicts.
- Resolving conflicts manually.
- Communicating with team members.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you've gained a foundational understanding of Python programming and Git version control. Feel free to explore more advanced topics and build upon this knowledge for your projects.
